# cipher

I wrote this program for my CSC 240 class, as part of the honors project. I
had a lot of fun with it, and have been working on it since then. It can
solve almost all of the cryptograms that I give it.  A good source of
cryptograms is http://www.cryptogramcorner.org/ . I use that site because it
is easy to copy and paste puzzles into the file that the program reads. I
programmed it to read a file because typing the puzzle in by hand would be
tedious and error prone.
